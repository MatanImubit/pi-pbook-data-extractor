# PI ProcessBook Tag Data Extractor

This tool can be used to extract extensive tag history from PI Server using ProcessBook only. The data can saved in CSV files (one file per tag).

## Usage

* Open PDI in your ProcessBook
* Select tags you are willing to extract. Tags can be selected in one of the following ways:
 * Importing text file with a single tag name per line
 * Adding tag names manually
 * Retrieving tags from open displays of active ProcessBook file (*.PIW). To use this option make sure only 1 PIW file is open with at least a single Display is viewed.
* Select time period you are interested in
* Click Extract

You can change "Block size" value if you run low on memory, or PI Server is limited on how much data can be fetched per transaction (this value is an amount of tag samples extracted in a single iteration)
